This project aims to study the methods used in Data science. Specifically in this project, we look to construct Multi-layer perceptron neural networks and a Convolutional neural network ( TensorFlow for CNN). We study Unsupervised learning using dimensionality reduction, clustering of feature matrix and group-based analysis. We also study Non-negative Matrix Factorization for dimensionality reduction and Community detection.
